I just developed a Python program that helps users efficiently manage their contact information. The program allows users to:
- ✍ Add new contacts by entering their name, phone number, and email address
- 📜 View the complete contact list
- 🖊 Edit existing contact details
- 🗑 Delete contacts when necessary

The program also offers options for storing contacts either in memory or in a file for persistent storage, ensuring that data is kept safe and accessible!

This project was a great exercise in practicing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations and file handling in Python. Looking forward to enhancing it with more features in the future!
